capabilites of Node:
Command-line tools (in shell script style)
An interactive-terminal style of programâ€”that is, a read-eval-print loop
(REPL)
Excellent process control functions to oversee child processes
A buffer object to deal with binary data
TCP or UDP sockets with comprehensive, event-driven callbacks
DNS lookup
An HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2-client server layered on top of the TCP
library filesystem access
Built-in rudimentary unit testing support through assertions.
2)multitasking refers to doing many tasks at the same time, multi-threading refers to the ability to process multiple threads at the same time. 
The async function approach solves that coding complexity. The coding style is more
natural since the results and errors land in the natural place, at the next line of
code. The await keyword integrates asynchronous result handling without blocking
the execution thread. A lot is buried under the covers of the async/await feature
