capabilites of Node:
Command-line tools (in shell script style)
An interactive-terminal style of programâ€”that is, a read-eval-print loop

Excellent process control functions to oversee child processes
A buffer object to deal with binary data
TCP or UDP sockets with comprehensive, event-driven callbacks
DNS lookup
An HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2-client server layered on top of the TCP
library filesystem access
Built-in rudimentary unit testing support through assertions.
